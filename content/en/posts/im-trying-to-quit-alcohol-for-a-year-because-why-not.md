This is one of those "hold me accountable" posts.
I want to see in a 12 months how great of a decission it was / how delusional and naive I was - yet to be decided on the outcome.
Here's why I decided to do it and what I expect out of it.

## Context

I'm Polish - we have a reputation to be a good drinkers and by "good" I mean that we can drink a lot.
It's part of the culture to celebrate with a bottle of vodka, our weddings are famous to last 2 days and be a marathon "drink, eat, dance" cycles, at some point of a christmass eve dinner a bottle meterialises on the table, alcohol is ever present part of our lifes.

## Motivation

### Break the peer pressure

This context is one of the reasons.
I enjoy drinking ocasionally but often find myself coerced into a drink just because I'm expected to drink.
I want to be in control of my actions.
I expect some awkward social situations
